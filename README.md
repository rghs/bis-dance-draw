## BIS Dance Draw Randomised

A very simple program to ensure reproducibility of pattern dance draws at Ice Dance events.

Requires a list of pattern dances provided as a json and the details of the segments to take place at the competition it is being used to draw for. The `2425_dances.json` and `competitions/2425/2411_dancequalifier.json` files serve as examples of how to provide these.
